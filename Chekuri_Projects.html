        <h3>Interstellar Battlestar</h3>
          <h3>September 19 - October 6, Intro to Computer Science and Software Engineering</h3>
          <p>In this project, my partner and I created a game using App Inventor. We used the game "Space Invaders" to build the basis of our game and then used App Inventor to remix it into our own game. We decided to make our app a retro-Galaxy themed shooter game in which the user can control their battle ship side to side and shoot upwards towards alien saucers that are coming down towards the ship. The game lasted exactly one minute, progressively getting more difficult, and the user had to hit enemy saucers to gain points. Hitting objects other than enemy saucers resulted in negative points. There was a health bar on the bottom of the screen representing the Galactic Empire's health which decreased every time an enemy saucer or a harmful object was not shot by the user on time. The game ended if the user survived one minute or the health bar reduced completely to 0. We were also able to add a quick tutorial in the beginning of the game to show users how to play.</p>
